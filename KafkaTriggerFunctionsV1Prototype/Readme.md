This contains a prototype implementation of a Kafka Trigger for Functions V1. It uses the .NET Confluent library. https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet

To make it running. Use the Kafka quick start : https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart to start a producer writing to a topic called test. 

Open the solutoin in Visual Studio and start running it. Anything that you write from the producer should be consumed by the Function.
